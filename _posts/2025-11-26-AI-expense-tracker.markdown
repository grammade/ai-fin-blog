Most expense trackers fail for one reason: they require manual discipline. Categories, tags, forms, dropdowns, and cleanup routines turn a simple habit into maintenance.

This system removes the work. 

The interface is WhatsApp. You submit entries the way you already speak: ayam 15k daging 20k, or any shorthand you already use. The system extracts amounts, infers categories, assigns tags, and classifies the transaction. You focus on the spending. The backend handles the rest.

Zero friction.  
No app.  
No navigation.  
No fields.

Each message becomes structured financial data automatically.

A web dashboard covers the analysis layer: summaries, charts, category breakdowns, monthly comparisons, and export tools. The dashboard exists for review, not input. All data starts as natural language and is converted by an LLM into searchable, organized records.

This is for users who want accuracy without clerical work. WhatsApp as the capture tool. AI as the interpreter. A dashboard as the control panel. Comprehensive tracking with minimal effort.
